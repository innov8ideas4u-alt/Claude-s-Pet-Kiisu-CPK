## What is this?

CPK turns a Flipper Zero (or Kiisu V4B clone) into Claude's **autonomous RF reconnaissance pet**. Claude doesn't just *advise* you on what to do with your Flipper — Claude *operates* it. Push a mission, walk away, come back to results.

The Flipper community's running joke is that the dolphin on screen is your "pet." CPK takes that literally: the dolphin's new owner is an AI.

### What that looks like in practice

Ask Claude something like:

> *"Find me a Sub-GHz weather sensor signal in this room, log it for 30 seconds, and tell me what frequency it's on."*

Under the hood, Claude:

1. Checks the device is unlocked (via RPC)
2. Writes a JavaScript mission script to the SD card
3. Launches the JS Runner with that script via direct RPC (no terminal, no CLI)
4. Waits while the Flipper scans
5. Sends a synthetic **BACK** press to exit cleanly
6. Reads the mission log
7. Answers you in plain English

No buttons pressed by you. No commands typed. Claude drives the device end to end.

## Why does this exist?

Three reasons:

1. **Teaching tool.** CPK is being built for [EDGE](https://example.org) — a non-profit teaching technical skills to at-risk youth. The "Claude drives the Flipper" framing makes hardware-security concepts *visible and tangible* for students who haven't worked with embedded devices before.

2. **CompTIA / cert prep.** The Flipper is becoming standard kit in security training. Letting students command it conversationally is the difference between "I memorized the menus" and "I understand what I'm asking the radio to do."

3. **AI-driven RF research.** Most LLMs can talk *about* Flippers. CPK is the first project (we know of) where an LLM *operates* one autonomously over a structured RPC interface, with mission verification and audit trails.

## Quickstart (~15 minutes)

You need: a Flipper Zero (or Kiisu V4B) running [Momentum firmware](https://momentum-fw.dev/), a USB cable, Python 3.11+, and either Claude Desktop or Claude Code.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:innov8ideas4u-alt/Claude-s-Pet-Kiisu-CPK.git
cd Claude-s-Pet-Kiisu-CPK
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate          # or source .venv/bin/activate on Linux/Mac
pip install -e .
```

Configure your AI agent to use the MCP server — see **[SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)** for step-by-step instructions including the device settings you need to enable on Momentum.

Then in Claude: *"What's connected? Run the ping mission."* — and watch.

## How it works (architecture)

```

The layers:

| Layer | What it does |
|---|---|
| **`flipper_mcp/`** | The Python MCP server. Wraps the Flipper's protobuf RPC into tools Claude can call (`flipper_app_start`, `flipper_gui_send_input`, `storage_write`, etc.). |
| **`cfc/`** | The **CPK Companion app** — a custom Flipper app (`.fap`) that exposes clean NFC / Sub-GHz capture primitives to Claude over a framed RPC channel, so it doesn't have to puppeteer the stock apps. |
| **`missions/`** | Higher-level mission framework. Reusable JS mission scripts + Python orchestration for multi-step flows. |
| **`proto/`** | The wire-protocol definitions. Reference for anyone adding new RPCs. |

For deeper architecture see **[`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md)**.

## What works today

### 🆕 The CPK Companion app (CFC) — first-class RF capture

CPK now ships a **custom Flipper app** that gives Claude direct, structured access to the radio hardware — no stock-app button-press choreography. Through it, Claude can:

- ✅ **Live NFC capture** — Claude arms the reader, you tap a card, and the real card data (UID + type) comes straight back through the AI. Verified on hardware against a real NTAG: continuous multi-tap capture under one subscription, with the radio cleanly released afterward (the stock NFC app still works once Claude is done).
- ✅ **Live Sub-GHz decoding** — Claude tunes the Flipper to 433.92 MHz and reports the **protocol, bit length, and key** of every decoded fixed-code transmission (garage remotes, weather sensors, etc.). Proven closed-loop: a second Flipper transmitting a known *Princeton* signal, decoded back with the exact key (`0xA34E44`, 24-bit), twenty presses in a row, zero drops.

Both were validated by **live-fire on real hardware**, not just unit tests — see [`docs/decisions/`](./docs/decisions/) for the full engineering story (including the firmware bugs only a real radio could expose).

### Driving the stock device

- ✅ **Direct app launch via RPC** — no CLI text-shell required. JS missions, NFC app, Sub-GHz app, all launchable without typing.
- ✅ **Synthetic button presses** — `flipper_gui_send_input(BACK)` etc. emit the full PRESS→SHORT→RELEASE triplet a real hardware press produces. All six keys validated on Momentum mntm-dev.
- ✅ **Lock-screen detection + dismissal** via direct RPC (`flipper_desktop_unlock`).
- ✅ **Mission cleanup** with a single BACK press — works for success screens, error dialogs, and stuck-running scripts alike.
- ✅ **Visible/audible mission feedback** via `notification.success()` / `notification.error()` from inside JS scripts — wakes the backlight, plays a sound, so the student/instructor can *see* Claude doing things.
- ✅ **Full diagnostic responses** — `app_start` returns the firmware's actual error name (`ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETERS`, `ERROR_APP_SYSTEM_LOCKED`, etc.) instead of just true/false.

## What's in flight

- 🚧 **On-device companion UI** — a playful "Clawd walks Kiisu" animation on the Flipper's 128×64 screen (Phase 4).
- 🚧 **More Sub-GHz protocols** — the decoder starts with fixed-code (Princeton). Rolling-code (KeeLoq etc.) needs a keystore and is deliberately deferred.
- 🚧 **BLE transport** — protocol-validated (see [`experiments/ble_probe/`](./experiments/ble_probe/)), needs final wire-up.
- 🚧 **Active-protocol mission category** (red-team / authorized-testing) — Sub-GHz replay, NFC clone, IR replay, RFID brute, BadUSB. All gated to owned-hardware / CTF-lab / explicit-authorization-only use. First missions will land in `missions/redteam/` as they're implemented.
- 🚧 **Minor fixes** — `storage_info` returning SD stats for `/int` requests (F2); a `kill_stale` helper so orphaned reader processes get cleaned up on exit.

See **[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)** for what's planned.
